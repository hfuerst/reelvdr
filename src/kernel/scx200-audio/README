Dependencies 
------------
- Linux Kernel 2.6.11
- ALSA rel. 1.6
- kernel patch v01.01.0302 or later (AC97 support,pcm_oss.c patch).
- To support OSS-based applications which use MMAP (like quake2) it's necessary
to patch the file pcm_oss.c in the kernel tree at "/linux-2.6.11/sound/core/oss"
Without this, the application is not able to open the driver correctly!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kernel Configuration
---------------------
- In order to use audio drivers under Linux, the ALSA
  modules have to be installed.  

  How to build the Kernel with the ALSA installed:

     1.  Type: "cd /usr/src/linux"
     2.  Type: "make menuconfig"
     3.  Select "Loadable module support" and un-check 
         "Module versioning support" if set.
     4.  Select "Device Drivers" option
     5.  Select "Sound" 
     6.  Select "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture" 
     7.  Select "PCI Devices"
     8.  Check "AC97" (press M to include as a module) 
     9.  From the main menu select exit, when prompted to save config, 
         say yes."  This will separate the enabling sound step from the 
         exit/save step and the build step.
         Save configuration and exit
     10  Type "make bzImage".  This will make the new kernel image.
     11. Type "make modules"
     12. Type "make modules_install".  This installs the modules on the system.
     13. Replace the system image on /boot with the bzImage that you generated
         It can be found at /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot


Compiling and installing the driver (standalone):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------    
- After unpacking the tarball, which contain the files listed above
  in a plain directory,  run :
  1. autoconf  (builds .configure)
  2. ./configure --with-kernel-path= "your path to the kernel sources"
  3. make install

    You need to have root permissions to build and install the driver.
  Follow the instructions of the install script
  The built driver will be located in the local directory as well as in
  /lib/modules/$kernel-path/kernel/drivers/misc
  (Make sure that module support is enabled in the kernel configuration)
         
  !!!! Additionally it's required to build the kernel with enabled ALSA - ac97 driver.
  When the ac97 driver is not available, the amd_geode audio driver cannot be loaded!!
  (see above) 

- run alsaconf  

The OSS emulation documentation can be found under $(KERNELDIR)/Documentation/sound/oss
or on the internet at http://www.alsa-project.org/~iwai/OSS-Emulation.html
