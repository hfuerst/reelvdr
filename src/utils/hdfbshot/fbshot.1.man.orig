.SH NAME
\fBfbshot\fP - takes screenshots from your framebuffer device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbshot [options] filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fbshot
reads your \fB24 or 32-bit\fP framebuffer device and saves a \fBPNG\fP image
file. You can use it for making screenshots of your framebuffer 
application or of your text or (n)curses applications (just
for fun). You can also use it to show somebody (who lives far away) 
your crazy framebuffer boot logo ;-) You may also use your shots in
presentations or anything. I think this program isn't for nothing.
Send \fBfeedback\fP for more suggestions to use it!
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
print usage informations
.TP
.B -c console
specifies which \fBconsole\fP (or virtual terminal - like other 
people call this feature) to grab. Sometimes this changing is 
faster then the framebuffer is refreshed (especially when grabbing
framebuffer apps). If so, you should \fBuse -C console\fP ... This
waits some time before grabbing. You can't use \fB-s\fP in this case.
.TP
.B -d device
specifies which framebuffer device you want to read. If 
you do not use this option, it takes the value from the 
\fBFRAMEBUFFER\fP environment variable. If no FRAMEBUFFER 
environment variable is given or if its value is \fBNULL\fP, the
DEFAULT_FB is taken. (see source code) If you got the official 
binary \fB.deb\fP package, this value is \fB/dev/fb0\fP ... Of 
course, if you received a \fB.rpm\fP, it is the same. And if you
take a look into the binary \fBELF\fP file you can still change
this standard.
.TP
.B -g
saves in \fBgrayscale\fP... 
.TP
.B -i
turns \fBoff\fP interlacing. If you do not want \fBADAM7 interlacing\fP, 
you should use the \fB-i\fP option.
.TP
.B -s seconds
specifies how many seconds to wait before grabbing. \fBfbshot\fP
does not lock console switching, so you can switch it while 
waiting and so you can use this feature if -c doesn't work 
as normal user and can't log in as root (see BUGS).
.SH BEEPS
Beeps tell you progress. First beep means "Yawn, why do you wake 
me?! Ok, ok, I start grabbing now...", second would say "Hey, cool,
grabbing the framebuffer was fine, now I gonna write a PNG file."
This can take some time, because the PNG file get compressed very 
high. Third beep means "So, here you got your PNG file, and now let
me sleep!"...
.SH WHY 32-BIT
Well, this is the only color depth which works correctly at my machine. I made
a switch(bits) within the \fBWrite_PNG\fP function, so you may add bit_depths
and color_types easily. I am not able to test such things, so I didn't want to 
code any stuff. But you may - \fBplease\fP do it, do it, do it! And then
send me patches. I will implement them (into the original) as soon as possible.
Although I cannot test it, I added \fB24-bit capability\fP, because I am sure it 
works. So please mail me if you are able to test it.
.SH WHY PNG
Reasons why I chose PNG for output format:

PNG is small, does everything I or you need for a screenshot. PNG is web 
standard. JPEG or GIF are web standard, too, but both JPEG and GIF are limited.
And libjpeg isn't working at my machine :-) and I needn't choose between libgif
or libungif or between some related full-featured graphic libs (libLUG, 
libMagick). But please notice: in some Netscape versions Netscape has some problems
with PNG when calling directly. It displays them \fBsmaller\fP, and with \fBblack 
bars\fP left and right. Within a HTML page there are \fBno\fP problems I know.
.SH BUGS
\fB-c\fP option does not work as non-root. But I do not want to setuid root
the binary, because this is a \fBsecurity hazard\fP. And I do not like such
hazards! Maybe it works with your kernel. Please mail me (with kernel version),
if so. If you are root, it should change to the console you specified two 
times (which is \fBnot\fP a bug).
.SH TODO
Nice, if some coders would help me, but the following is \fBmy task\fP, no 
other people should code that:
.nf

    * a preview function, which generates a 
	downscaled 100x75 picture

.fi
Not even think of that!!!! Or you get onto the deadkiss list of my personal 
mafia ;-)
But, of course, you may do something:
.nf

    * port it to and test it on other color depths!!!
    * make options to specify compression (I think, that's not important)
    * remove bugs and make bugs (but only unintentionly!)
    * send me mail (suggestions, tips, critics)...
.fi

.SH GETTING NEW VERSIONS
You may visit my homepage for newer versions of fbshot:

    \fBhttp://www.copyleft.de/~sbeyer\fP
    \fBftp://www.copyleft.de/pub/project/fbshot\fP

if you are not able to remind this short url, you can also try

    \fBhttp://www.s-beyer.de\fP

for a shorter-written redirect, which adds an advertising banner 
window if you enabled JavaScript in your browser. :-)
You should be able to download \fBtar.gz\fPed source codes, binary 
\fB.deb\fPs, alien-mutated \fB.rpm\fPs and \fBdiff\fPed patches. I 
hope you decide for the source codes, because I want some people who
code new features on that. Thanks...
.SH THANKS TO
Thanks to \fBGlenn Randers-Pehrson\fP <randeg@alum.rpi.edu> who helped
me with some basic libPNG things.
I also have to thank \fBElliot Lee\fP <sopwith@redhat.com> who sent 
me code for converting 8bpp to 24bpp, although this didn't work at my 
machine. I also didn't implement it into the program, but the code contains 
it...
Also thanks to \fBFrank Kaefer\fP <fbshot@sta.to> who I met at #linux.de 
in IRCnet. Caused by him I noticed, that fbshot had a real heavy bug in 
its first two versions.
\fBliff\fP I also met at IRCnet, channel #c. He helped me with some basic 
bit operation stuff. Also thanks to him. 
Thanks, of course, to everyone who downloaded this program, too. If you send 
me mail I'll call you here (if you want). 
So thanks to 
\fBBrad Douglas\fP <brad@neruo.com>, 
\fBEdmund Haworth\fP <oliver.legion@bigfoot.com>, 
\fBElliot Lee\fP <sopwith@redhat.com>, 
\fBFrank Kaefer\fP <fbshot@sta.to> 
\fBGlenn Randers-Pehrson\fP <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>, 
\fB<imaginate@elektromensch.de>\fP, 
and you? mail me if you want to be called here. 
You may tell me Realname and e-mail and what you are thinking of this program, 
send me patches, comments, questions - what you want...
