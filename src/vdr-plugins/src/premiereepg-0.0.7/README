This plugin parses the extended EPG data which is send by Premiere on their
portal channels (e.g. SPORT PORTAL). This EPG data is transmitted in a
non-standard format on a non-standard PID.

This work is based on the premiereepg2vdr commandline tool, which was written
by Axel Katzur software@katzur.de.
premiereepg2vdr can be found at:

Note: the EPG entries created with this plugin aren't fully compatible with
entries created by premiereepg2vdr. This plugin used a different sheme (IMO more
reliable) to map the EventID. If you're upgrading from premiereepg2vdr you
should delete your epg.data file, otherwise you will see duplicate EPG events.

The plugin can tag option events i.e. the same event with the same time on
different channels e.g. F1 sub channels. The tagging format (e.g. before or
after event name) can be selected in the plugin setup menu.
In addition there are two switches in the plugin setup menu to control inclusion
of order and parental rating information into the event description.

Beside this, there is nothing big to say:

- There are no commandline options for this plugin.
- There is no plugin mainmenu entry.
- Everything should work automatically. Whenever a device is tuned to a Premiere
  channel i.e. by EPG scan or manually, the Premiere EPG scan is triggered.
