Description:

A streaming client using VLC as server.
VLC streams reencodes every video it can play on-the-fly to MPEG2-TS and streams
it to this plugin - which replays it.

What's needed:

- A VLC >= version 0.8.5 running on another computer with option "--with-extraintf=http".

How to use:

You need a VLC (version >= 0.8.5 is needed) running on another computer.
It must be startet with "--with-extraintf=http"". If you're running windows
the easiest way to start with this option is to edit the shortcut to the application.
Short description:
  After installing VLC, right-click on "VLC media player" on your desktop, click on
  "Properties", then select "Shortcut" and append ' --extraintf=http' to the "Target:"-line.
  Then "Apply", "OK" - you're done.
  Start it.
If you're using linux simply start VLC with 'vlc --extraintf="http"'.
If you're using MacOSX start your VLC by typing (assuming VLC is installed under /Applications) 
  "/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC --extraintf=http".
Finally set up the remote IP and directory at the setup-menu.
Examples for the remote directory:
  windows: "C:\"
  linux: "/home/someuser/movies"
  MacOSX: "/Users/someuser/Movies"
That's it - now you should be able to watch every movie VLC can play using your VDR.
