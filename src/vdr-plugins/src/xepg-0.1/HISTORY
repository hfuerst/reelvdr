VDR Plugin 'xmlepg2vdr' Revision History
----------------------------------------

2007-11-30: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
  1. Downloads EPG data from bleb.org in XML format.
  2. Uses libcurl for downloading.
  3. Channel schedules are updated forcibly (ie. the downloaded data is considered more accurate than the existing EPG data in VDR)
  4. Uses url.list in cPlugins::ConfigDirectory("xmlrpg2vdr") directory.
  5. See URLREADME for the format of url.list
  6. Uses /tmp for storing downloaded EPG data. (Each URL has a seperate data file, also overwritten everytime download starts)
