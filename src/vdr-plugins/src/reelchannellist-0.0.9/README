Description:
   Displays vdr's channel list (with current event when possible).
   Allows for filtering of channels by 'Providers', and Source/satellite.

   Provides a seperate favourites list, that is independent of vdr's channel list.



The above four are the "main" windows of this plugin.
"All Channels", "Sources", "Favourites", "Providers"


"All Channels" menu: 
    Simply lists all channels in vdr's list (channels.conf) excluding channels that are group separators.


"Sources" menu:
    list all sources found in vdr's channel list 
    filtering channel list with one of those source
    also provides a filter for channels from the current transponder


"Favourites" menu:
    all channel entries in Favourites are "inside" bouquets
    One bouquet contains 0 or more unique channels from vdr's channel list
    One vdr's channel maybe present in more than one fav. bouquet
       therefore, fav. list may contain duplicate channels 
       (but not inside one bouquet)


"Providers" menu:
    lists all channel providers found in vdr's channel list
    filtering of channel list with one of the providers



Favourites:
   add one channel from vdr's channel list to one of favourites's folders
     (within one folder all channels are unique)
   add one provider into favourites list
     (as a folder that cannot be renamed)
   add one source/satellite into favourites list
     (as a folder that cannot be renamed)

   Delete a folder
   Rename a folder
   Delete a channel

   Move a folder
   Move a channel within its folder


Active Channel list
   Active Channel list assumes the user wants to zap through a restricted channel list.
   The restriction is the same as the active channel filters, ie the present view of channellist.
   Restriction maybe applied to just the favourites list or to vdr's channellist.
