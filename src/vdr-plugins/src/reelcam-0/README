Description:

This plugin manages the CAMs of the Reelbox.

How it works:
=============

Basically it cheats VDR.

There are 2 CI-Slots, 1 built-in Neotion CAM and up to 4 tuners in the reelbox.
Each of the CI/CAMs can be associated with each tuner.
In addition, the supply of power to the CAMs can be switched off and on and the
state of CAMs (being plugged in or not) can be queried.
As VDR and the DVB drivers are unable to handle dynamic CAM<->tuner association
we chose this way:
All CAMs are on DVB-driver side associated with adapter0, so VDR is able to
access the CAM-Menus on this adapter.
On each channel switch, the plugin compares the caIDs of the channel, the
capabilites of the CAMs and then switches the needed CAM to the tuner doing
the channel switch.
