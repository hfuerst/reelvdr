Apply patches in plugin-source directory with
    patch -p1 < patch-file

After applying patches the plugins works as expected even if mediamanager is
not running.

Notes on mp3 and image plugin
-----------------------------

remove any entry which points to the cdrom device in
mp3sources.conf and/or imagesources.conf

to use these plugins without any files on harddisk create an empty
mp3sources.conf and/or imagesources.conf

if harddisk directorys are defined in mp3sources.conf and/or imagesources.conf
you will get your normal plugin mainmenuentrys and if a disc is inserted an
additional entry named "Media Mp3" or "Media Image"
