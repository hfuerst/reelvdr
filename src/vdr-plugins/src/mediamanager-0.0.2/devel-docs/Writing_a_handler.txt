Use ./newhandler <name>

For example if you want writing a handler for Video-DVD
type ./newhandler dvd
This command creates a directory media_dvd with the following files:

Handler.include:
	add your objects to HANDLEROBJS
	add additionally required libs to HANDLERLIBS

HandlerClassName
	you must edit this file if you don't like the default handler classname

i18n.include
	put your translations here

dvd_handler.[ch]
dvd_disc.[ch]
dvd_menu.[ch]
	header and source files to write your handler


To compile the handler put a line 'media_dvd' in COMPILE_HANDLERS.
