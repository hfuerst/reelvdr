The following steps are required for plugins to use mediamanager service
interface:

Plugin Start function:
	create new cMediaService()
	check if mediamanager plugin is available
	if so create MediaManager_Register_v1_0 and register.
	if successful registered use SetManager() function to set manager in cMediaService
	now you can use static functions in cMediaService, if mediamanager is not avaiable
	these functions do nothing.

Plugin MainMenuEntry and
Plugin MainMenuAction functions
	should (but must not) return NULL (see mp3 and image plugin patches)

Plugin Service function
	if receive MEDIA_MANAGER_ACTIVATE_ID read required info from the disc
	if receive MEDIA_MANAGER_MAINMENU_ID create a cOsdObject or return NULL
	   and your plugin is called by cRemote::CallPlugin

Of course you should include 'mediaservice.h' and add mediaservice.o to your
OBJS in Makefile
for details look at audiocd example or patches.
