VDR Plugin 'mediamanager' Revision History
-------------------------------------

2007-04-12: Version 0.0.2
- Removed Makefile-APIVERSION directory. Makefile works now for all VDR-Versions
- Fixed a bug in cMediaHandler::Action avoiding endless mount/umount loop if
  mediatype is mtMp3Data or mtPhotoData
- Renamed mediatype mtMp3Data to mtAudioData and mtPhotoData to mtImageData
  now checks for mp3, ogg, wav files and jpg, png, tif, bmp files
- Moved some stuff from Start() to Initialize() function so plugins can register
  itself even if mediamanager is started after
- Changed default behaviour for unsupported discs. Unsupported discs are no
  longer ejected, but mediamanager still checks for disc removing. If this
  behaviour interfere other plugins they may use the new service (see below) or
  mediamanager must be deactivated manually.
- Added new service "Suspend". Plugins which have their own idea of
  mediahandling can use this service to deactivate mediamangers device polling.
  To use this service plugins must not be registered.
  This is primary for plugins like burn or dvdconvert.
- Plugins which return NULL for cOsdObject in MediaManager_Mainmenu_v1_0 struct
  are now called by cRemote::CallPlugin
- Added patches directory which contains patches for plugins to work with
  mediamanager
- Added mediaservice.c in devel-docs for easy implementation of mediamanager
  support to plugins without destroying normal functionality of plugins.

2007-02-13: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
