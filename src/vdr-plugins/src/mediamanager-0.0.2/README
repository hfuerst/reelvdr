Description:

The "mediamanager" plugin autodetects CDs/DVDs inserted in your CD/DVD-Rom drive
and starts a suitable compiled in handler or a registered plugin (if there is
one which supports the mediamanager service interface).

Menu:
If there is no disc in your CD/DVD-Rom drive the mainmenuentry is Media Manager
and shows informations about compiled in handlers and registered plugins. You
can also (de)activate Media Manager here with the red button and use another plugin
or open the tray (yellow button).
In the other case it is replaced by the mainmenuentry of the handler or plugin
and the menu popup.

Currently mediamanager detects the following mediatypes:
	blank discs
	digital audio cd
	Video DVD
	SVCD
	VCD
	DVD with VDR recordings (VDR directory structure required)
	CD/DVD containing audio files
	CD/DVD containing image files

Currently the following handlers are available:
	media_vdrarchiv: plays DVDs with VDR recordings
	media_cdda     : simple audio CD player based on libcdio


Installation and Requirements:

	* vdr >= 1.3.42
	* libcdio >= 0.78.2 if you want compile media_cdda
	* fstab entry for CD/DVD device
	  for example: /dev/foo  /media/foo  auto  ro,noauto,user,exec  0  0
	* at least read access for the CD/DVD device

First edit COMPILE_HANDLERS:

By default only 'media_vdrarchiv' is compiled.

Edit config.h for mount and umount command.
